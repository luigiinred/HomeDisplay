      </div>

      <p>
        At Aerial Picture Frame, we are committed to protecting your privacy above all
        else. This Privacy Policy explains our privacy-first approach and how we
        handle your information when you use our mobile application.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>We collect absolutely no information about you.</strong> Aerial
        Picture Frame is designed with privacy as the core principle. Here's what this
        means:
      </p>

      <h3>No Account Required</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Registration:</strong> You do not need to create an account
          to use Aerial Picture Frame. Simply download and start using the app
          immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect your name, email
          address, or any other personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Login Required:</strong> There are no usernames, passwords,
          or authentication systems.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Local-Only Operation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Device-Only Storage:</strong> All your photos, calendar data,
          settings, and preferences are stored locally on your
          device only.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not store any of your data on
          our servers or in the cloud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> Your photos and personal data
          never leave your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not track how you use the app or
          collect any usage statistics.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information</li>
        <li>No device identifiers</li>
        <li>No usage analytics</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No network information</li>
        <li>No crash reports</li>
        <li>No performance metrics</li>
        <li>No user behavior data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >We don't use your information because we don't collect any.</strong
        >
        Since all data remains on your device, we have no access to your
        information and therefore cannot use it for any purpose.
      </p>
      <p>What this means for you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete Control:</strong> You have full control over your
          photos and personal data at all times
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Mining:</strong> We cannot analyze, sell, or share
          your data because we don't have it
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Targeted Advertising:</strong> We cannot create profiles or
          target you with ads
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> Since we don't collect data,
          there's nothing to share with third parties
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >We cannot share your information because we don't collect
          any.</strong
        >
        Since all your data stays on your device, there is no information for us
        to share with anyone.
      </p>
      <p>This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> We cannot share your data with
          service providers, advertisers, or any third parties
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Legal Disclosure:</strong> We cannot be compelled to
          disclose your data because we don't have it
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger or
          acquisition, there is no data to transfer
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Government Requests:</strong> We cannot comply with
          government data requests because we don't have any data
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Your data is already secure because it never leaves your
          device.</strong
        >
        Since we don't collect, store, or transmit any of your information,
        there is no data for us to secure on our end.
      </p>
      <p>Security benefits of our approach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Breaches:</strong> We cannot be hacked because we
          don't store your data
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Server Vulnerabilities:</strong> Your data isn't on our
          servers, so it can't be compromised
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Network Interception:</strong> We don't transmit your data,
          so it can't be intercepted
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device-Level Security:</strong> Your data is protected by your
          device's built-in security features
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>We don't retain any data because we don't collect any.</strong>
        All your information remains on your device under your complete control.
        You can delete the app at any time, and all your data will be removed
        with it.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >You have complete control over your data because it never leaves your
          device.</strong
        >
        Since we don't collect any information, traditional privacy rights don't
        apply, but you have even greater control:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete Ownership:</strong> You own and control 100% of your
          data at all times
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Instant Deletion:</strong> Delete the app and all your data is
          gone immediately
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Requests:</strong> You don't need to request your data
          because it's already on your device
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Opt-Out Needed:</strong> There's nothing to opt out of
          because we don't collect anything
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device-Level Control:</strong> Use your device's privacy
          settings to control app permissions
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Aerial Picture Frame may connect to your photo libraries and calendar services, but
        this communication happens directly between your device and these services. We do not act as an intermediary or collect any data from
        these interactions.
      </p>
      <p>Important points about third-party integrations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct Communication:</strong> Your device communicates
          directly with your photo libraries and calendar services
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Data Interception:</strong> We don't intercept, store, or
          process any data from these communications
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your Device's Privacy:</strong> The privacy of these
          communications is controlled by your device's settings and the
          individual service providers
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Third-Party Data Collection:</strong> We don't share any
          data with service providers because we don't collect any
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >We don't collect information from anyone, including children.</strong
        >
        Since our app doesn't collect any personal information from users of any
        age, children's privacy is inherently protected. There is no data for us
        to collect, store, or process from children or adults.
      </p>
      <p>Privacy protection for all users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Age Verification:</strong> We don't need to verify age
          because we don't collect data
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Parental Consent:</strong> No parental consent is needed
          because no data is collected
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Universal Privacy:</strong> The same privacy protections apply
          to users of all ages
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Special Handling:</strong> Children's data doesn't require
          special handling because we don't have any
        </li>
      </ul>
